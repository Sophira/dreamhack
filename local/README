The directory contains local settings files that will be different for each dev
machine that has been set up to be a Dreamhack server.

Copy over the sample file in samples/ (renaming them so that they don't have
the ".sample" extension) and chmod/chown the settings.root file so that it can
only be read by root:

    cp samples/settings.root settings.root
    cp samples/settings.nonroot settings.nonroot
    cp samples/settings.shared settings.shared
    chown root:root settings.root
    chmod 0600 settings.root

The settings.shared file contains settings that will typically be different for
every deployment. The settings are fairly self-explanatory; make sure that
they're correct for your deployment.

The settings.root and setting.nonroot files should contain the credentials for
three database users:

* root: This is necessary information because the ability to create/drop
        databases and users, and grant privileges to users, is inherently
        required in the process of creating new Dreamhacks. You can set up
        another user with the necessary privileges to do this if you want, but
        when you have the power to drop whole databases and grant privileges,
        you may as well just use root.

        These credentials are controlled by the "dh_db_root_username" and
        "dh_db_root_password" settings in settings.root.

* dreamhacks: This user should have read-write access (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,
              DELETE, LOCK TABLES) to all tables of the "dreamhacks" database.

              These credentials are controlled by the
              "dh_db_readwrite_username" and "dh_db_readwrite_password"
              settings in settings.root.

* dreamhacks_ro: This user should have read-only access (SELECT only) to the
                 "users" and "userports" tables of the "dreamhacks" database.
                 It should not have any access to the "user_emails" table.

                 These credentials are controlled by the
                 "dh_db_readonly_username" and "dh_db_readonly_password"
                 settings in settings.nonroot.
